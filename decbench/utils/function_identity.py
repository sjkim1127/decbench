"""Collision-safe function identity helpers.

DecBench historically stores decompilation results and several DWARF-derived
maps by unqualified function name. That is sufficient for the current C corpus,
but it collapses C++ overloads and same-named functions in different scopes.

This module provides two small building blocks for migrating that behavior
without changing non-colliding results:

* :func:`dwarf_function_identities` extracts concrete DWARF subprograms keyed by
  binary-local address while retaining the human-readable and linkage names.
* :func:`insert_function` keeps the legacy plain-name key while it is unique,
  and upgrades every colliding entry to ``<name>@0x<address>`` only when a real
  same-name/different-address collision appears.

Address is the canonical identity primitive *within one binary*. Linkage names
are retained as a strong C++ source/oracle join key, but are not required (for
example ``main`` normally has no C++ linkage name).
